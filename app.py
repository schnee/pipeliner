        This application helps estimate the probability of attaining a target revenue from a 'basket' of sales deals **within a given time period**.

        **How to Use:**
        1.  Set the desired **Target Revenue** in the sidebar.
        2.  Prepare a **CSV file** containing your deals. You can use this Google Sheet template - make a copy, edit your deals, ensure column names are unchanged, and export as CSV.
            * **Required Columns:** `name`, `revenue_lo`, `rev_lo_prob`, `revenue_hi`, `rev_hi_prob`, `booking_mean`, `booking_var`.
            * `name`: Unique identifier for the deal.
            * `revenue_lo`: Low-end estimated revenue if the deal closes.
            * `rev_lo_prob`: Probability of the revenue being the low-end amount (if the deal closes).
            * `revenue_hi`: High-end estimated revenue if the deal closes.
            * `rev_hi_prob`: Probability of the revenue being the high-end amount (must be `1 - rev_lo_prob`).
            * `booking_mean`: The average probability (0 to 1) that the deal will close (book).
            * `booking_var`: The variance around the `booking_mean`. Represents uncertainty in the booking probability. Use 0 variance for deals with fixed probabilities (e.g., 1.0 mean and 0 var for a 100% certain deal).
        3.  Upload the CSV file using the **Upload Deals CSV File** button in the sidebar.
        4.  Adjust the **Number of Simulations** if desired (more simulations = potentially more accurate but slower).
        5.  Click the **Run Simulation** button.

        **Output:**
        * **Simulation Results Tab:**
            * A **density plot** showing the distribution of possible total revenues based on the simulations. The shaded area represents simulations exceeding the target revenue.
            * The overall **probability of exceeding the target revenue**.
            * A **table** showing specific revenue levels and the estimated probability of achieving *at least* that much revenue.
        * **Input Deals Tab:** Shows the data you uploaded.
        * **Help Tab:** This information.

        **Important Considerations:**
        * **Data Validity:** Ensure `rev_lo_prob + rev_hi_prob = 1` for each deal. Also, ensure the booking probability range (`booking_mean ¬± booking_var`) stays within [0, 1]. The app performs basic checks.
        * **Variance:** The `booking_var` must be mathematically possible for the given `booking_mean` (specifically, `variance < mean * (1 - mean)`). If the variance is too high, the calculated Beta distribution parameters (alpha, beta) can become invalid, and the simulation may warn or stop.
        * **Model Assumptions:** This model assumes deal outcomes are independent and that the Beta distribution is appropriate for modeling booking uncertainty.
